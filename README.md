## About Me

My name is Wojciech Tylenda. In the past, I worked physically most of the time. A few years ago I realized that I enjoyed striving for perfection in certain small things. Additionally, just looking for imperfections in order to eliminate or improve them also began to satisfy me. I started getting interested in software testing almost a year ago. Week by week, I started to like it more and more. For about 6 months, I have been constantly acquiring new skills in this field. My goal is to be. My goal is to become a software tester. First manual, and then over time I want to develop in test automation.
